                    is a distinguished aviation professional with a career
                    spanning two decades in the industry. He possesses a solid
                    foundation in aviation, underpinned by a mechanical
                    engineering degree earned at Concordia University in
                    Montreal, Canada, and an Executive MBA (EMBA) degree from
                    HEC Paris.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Throughout his remarkable career, Alexander has undertaken a
                    variety of pivotal sales roles at globally renowned
                    companies, including GE Aviation, Boeing Commercial
                    Aircraft, and Textron. His unwavering commitment to aviation
                    excellence has been the driving force behind his
                    accomplishments.
                </p>
                <h4 class="h4 about-pro__title">Passion for <br />Aviation</h4>
                <p>
                    Alexander's passion for aviation was ignited early in life,
                    propelling him into a career that has spanned continents and
                    soared to great heights. His relentless dedication to the
                    aviation industry and its transformative potential fuels his
                    pursuit of excellence.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One defining moment that shaped Alexander's aviation career
                    was his role as a sales director for GE Aviation, where he
                    spearheaded sales efforts in Central Asia, an untapped
                    region for the company. His responsibilities included
                    identifying new opportunities, crafting persuasive sales
                    proposals, negotiating value propositions, and ultimately
                    closing deals. This endeavor set the stage for numerous
                    successful campaigns, including the selection of GEnx
                    engines for Uzbekistan Airways and Azerbaijan Airlines' 787
                    fleet, as well as collaborative efforts with the CFM team to
                    promote CFM56 power for the A320 family.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Subsequently, Alexander assumed the role of Director of
                    Marketing at Boeing Commercial Aircraft, where he delved
                    deep into the intricacies of aircraft sales processes and
                    engaged with diverse customers across the region. His
                    contributions were instrumental in achieving sales records,
                    including the largest volume deal in the region.
                </p>
                <h4 class="h4 about-pro__title">Leadership</h4>
                <p>
                    An extended role as a sales program manager and later, as an
                    Executive Director at Textron Inc, offered Alexander
                    invaluable leadership experience. Over eight years with
                    Textron, his team achieved outstanding results, securing
                    competitive deals and engaging in complex transactions.
                    Noteworthy accomplishments include local assembly of Bell
                    407GX helicopters and the sale of C172 training aircraft to
                    state schools. This phase of his career also provided
                    insight into corporate leadership, including interactions
                    with boards of directors, CEO offices, and collaboration
                    with various Textron businesses, including Cessna and Bell
                    Helicopters.
                </p>
                <p class="p-body about-pro-last__text">
                    Alexander's unwavering passion for aviation even led him to
                    the skies, where he earned a private pilot license and
                    logged over 100 hours of flight time. This profound
                    connection to aviation drives his commitment to delivering
                    exceptional value to clients.
